Mech Tweaker allows for customization of mechanical game elements such as timers, statues, and traps.

By adjusting values in the config, you can customize timing and limits.

Statues are normally limited to 3 items or 3 npc spawned, but adjusting the "Statue Limits" options can customize this limit.

Timers, traps, and statues also have various cooldowns which can also be adjusted.

To speed up a timer triggering a statue, both "Timer Speed Multiplier" and "Mechanic Speed Multiplier" need to be used together.

Be wary of extreme speeds in multiplayer play, as spawning traps extremely fast could cause lag, especially if there are several traps.

Also note that Spiky Ball Traps can't yet be sped up very much since the spiky ball limit is still in effect.
